Unit test example in golang
==========================

We would like to test user.User.Use(), that method calls an interface
Doer.

Use gomock to generage mock interface.

Besides, there's a lib function call, us gostub to stub that method.

There are 2 packages:
user and user1, the test cases are wrote with differents test framework.

GoMock
======
Use Gomock to Mock interface

Convey
======
Use convey to do BDD testing

gostub
======
Use gostub to stub variable/function ...

But we need to define function as a variable. see lib/lib.go
